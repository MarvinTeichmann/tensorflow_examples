This folder contain objective python functions. Each should contain the following functions:

* loss
* training
* evaluation

See below for a detailed description.


def loss(logits, labels):
  """Calculates the loss from the logits and the labels.

  Args:
    logits: Logits tensor, float - [batch_size, NUM_CLASSES].
    labels: Labels tensor, int32 - [batch_size].

  Returns:
    loss: Loss tensor of type float.


def training(loss, global_step=0, learning_rate=None):
  """Sets up the training Ops.

  Creates a summarizer to track the loss over time in TensorBoard.

  Creates an optimizer and applies the gradients to all trainable variables.

  The Op returned by this function is what must be passed to the
  `sess.run()` call to cause the model to train.

  Args:
    loss: Loss tensor, from loss().
    global_step: Integer Variable counting the number of training steps
      processed.
    learning_rate: The learning rate to use for gradient descent.

  Returns:
    train_op: The Op for training.
  """


def evaluation(logits, labels):
  """Evaluate the quality of the logits at predicting the label.

  Args:
    logits: Logits tensor, float - [batch_size, NUM_CLASSES].
    labels: Labels tensor, int32 - [batch_size], with values in the
      range [0, NUM_CLASSES).

  Returns:
    A scalar int32 tensor with the number of examples (out of batch_size)
    that were predicted correctly.
